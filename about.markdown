                I am just a person who has reached junior high school education, in 2014 when I first learned about programming language, at that time I was not interested enough to learn it.<br/><br/>and at the end of 2015 I started studying programming without a teacher, with an intention and an old computer, I started learning Pascal, at that time I learned after downloading Pascal language material in pdf form, I don't know where I got it, I don't remember it.<br/><br/>I don't even remember the Pascal language anymore, I also started learning java, c, c ++, Just to know the language, because I was not interested in making desktop software, I was more interested in creating a website because my inspiration at that time was Facebook.<br/><br/>With the tutorials scattered on the Google search engine, I can learn web programming language until now, for that I thank the developers who continue to share tutorials.
